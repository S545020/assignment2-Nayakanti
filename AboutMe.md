# Radha Nayakanti
Myself Radha Naykanti. I am very Enthusiastic and proactive person. I always prefer travelling alone. From my childhood, I am a sports person and love to play Badminton, Table Tennis and Throw ball. My Favourite Indian Cuisine is Hyderabadi Biryani. I love my father a lot but unfortunately I lost him 13 years ago. This was the only one sadest thing happened in my life. Iâ€™m most scared of ghosts.The hobby that I could never give up is reading Mahabharat. One craziest thing about me is, I could'nt live without Tea. My perfect day would start with cup of tea. I always love wearing traditional clothes. The best part in my everyday activites is cooking. My friends always annoys me for my height. One of my favorite things to do is playing guitar at the time of sunset near beach.
